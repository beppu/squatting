squatting Example -p 4235

  http://localhost:4236/

  This is the first example app I made.
  I tried to show a little bit of everything here.
  For sillyness points, I used CGI.pm's HTML generating functions
  as my templating system.  ;-)

squatting PODServer -p 4236

  http://localhost:4236/

  requires:
    Pod::Simple
    HTML::AsSubs

  This will let you browse (almost) all the POD that's
  installed on your system.  I wrote this before I was aware of
  Pod::Webserver which basically does the same thing.
  However, I may still make a separate dist out of this
  and put it on CPAN.
