squatting Example -p 4235

  http://localhost:4236/

  This is the first example app I made.
  I tried to show a little bit of everything here.
  For sillyness points, I used CGI.pm's HTML generating functions
  as my templating system.  ;-)

squatting PODServer -p 4236

  http://localhost:4236/

  requires:
    Pod::Simple
    HTML::AsSubs

  This will let you browse (almost) all the POD that's
  installed on your system.  I wrote this before I was aware of
  Pod::Webserver which basically does the same thing.
  However, I may still make a separate dist out of this
  and put it on CPAN, because its output is pretty, and
  it has some nice little usability features.

  Be on the lookout for Pod::Server
  ...coming to a CPAN mirror near you.

squatting UniCodePoints -p 4237 --config count=1024

  http://localhost:4237/

  requires:
    HTML::AsSubs

  This is a simple utility for displaying unicode code points.
  You can configure the default number of codepoints to display per page
  by passing in --config count=XXX where XXX is a positive integer.

squatting Chat -p 4238

  http://localhost:4238/

  requires
    selfvars
    HTML::AsSubs
    Coro::Event

  This is a port of chat-ajax-push.pl from the Continuity examples.
  Open this page up in 2 or more different browsers and chat.
