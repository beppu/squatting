           . . . a Camping-inspired Web Microframework for Perl . . .

            A note for Awwaiid -- your first impression might be
            that I completely missed the point of Continuity, but
            do not worry.  I am not done w/ Squatting, yet.

            RESTless controllers are coming soon, and they will
       (not RESTful)                        take full advantage of
                                             the foundation that
                                              Continuity has provided
                                               for the Squatting Microframework.




            A note for _why (if he happens to ever wander in here).
            I can't thank you enough for Camping.
            Its API is beautiful!

            (That's why I must share it with the Perl people.)
