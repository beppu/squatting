Squatting::Controller - default controller class for Squatting

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package App::Controllers;
  use Squatting ':controllers';
  our @C = (
    C(
      Thread => [ '/forum/(\d+)/thread/(\d+)-(\w+)' ],
      get => sub {
        my ($self, $forum_id, $thread_id, $slug) = @_;
        #
        # get thread from database...
        #
        $self->render('thread');
      },
      post => sub {
        my ($self, $forum_id, $thread_id, $slug) = @_;
        # 
        # add post to thread
        #
        $self->redirect(R('Thread', $forum_id, $thread_id, $slug));
      }
    )
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Squatting::Controller is the default controller class for Squatting
applications.  Its job is to take HTTP requests and construct an appropriate
response by setting up output headers and returning content.

=head1 API

=head2 Object Construction

=head3 Squatting::Controller->new($name => \@urls, %methods)

The constructor takes a name, an arrayref or URL patterns, and a hash of
method definitions.  There is a helper function called C() that makes this
slightly less verbose.

=head3 $self->clone([ %opts ])

This will create a shallow copy of the controller.  You may optionally pass in
a hash of options that will be merged into the new clone.

=head2 HTTP Request Handlers

=head3 $self->get(@args)

=head3 $self->post(@args)

=head3 $self->put(@args)

=head3 $self->delete(@args)

=head3 $self->head(@args)

=head3 $self->options(@args)

=head3 $self->trace(@args)

=head3 $self->connect(@args)

These methods are called when their respective HTTP requests are sent to the
controller.  @args is the list of regex captures from the URL pattern in
$self->urls that matched $self->env->{REQUEST_PATH}.

=head2 Attribute Accessors

The following methods are lvalue subroutines that contain information
relevant to the current controller and current request/response cycle.

=head3 $self->name

This returns the name of the controller.

=head3 $self->urls

This returns the arrayref of URL patterns that the controller responds to.

=head3 $self->cr

This returns the L<Continuity::Request> object for the current session.

=head3 $self->env

This returns a hashref populated with a CGI-like environment.  This is where
you'll find the incoming HTTP headers.

=head3 $self->input

This returns a hashref containing the incoming CGI parameters.

B<Example>:  Interpreting the query ?x=5&y=true&z=2&z=1&z=3 .

  $self->input->{x} is         5
  $self->input->{y} is    "true"
  $self->input->{z} is [2, 1, 3]

=head3 @keys = $self->param

=head3 $value = $self->param($key)

=head3 $self->param($key, $value)

This is an accessor for C<$self-E<gt>input> that provides an API that's a
subset of the L<CGI> module's C<param()> function.  It exists, because there
are many perl modules that can make use of an object that follows this API.  It
is not complete, but it should be good enough for L<WWW::Facebook::API::Canvas>
and many other modules.

=head3 $self->cookies

This returns a hashref that holds both the incoming and outgoing cookies.

Incoming cookies are just simple scalar values, whereas outgoing cookies are
hashrefs that can be passed to L<CGI::Cookie> to construct a cookie string.

B<Example>:  Setting a cookie named 'foo'

  $self->cookies->{foo} = { -Value => 'bar', -Expires => '+1d' };

B<Example>:  Getting the value of a cookie named 'baz'

  my $baz = $self->cookies->{baz};

=head3 $self->state

If you've setup sessions, this method will return the current session 
data as a hashref.

=head3 $self->v

This returns a hashref that represents the outgoing variables for this
request.  This hashref will be passed to a view's templates when render()
is called.

=head3 $self->status

This returns an integer representing the outgoing HTTP status code.
See L<HTTP::Status> for more details.

  $self->status = 404;  # Resource Not Found

=head3 $self->headers

This returns a hashref representing the outgoing HTTP headers.

B<Example>:  Setting the outgoing Content-Type to text/plain

  $self->headers->{'Content-Type'} = 'text/plain';

=head3 $self->log

This returns a logging object if one has been set up for your app.  If it
exists, you should be able to call methods like C<debug()>, C<info()>,
C<warn()>, C<error()>, and C<fatal()> against it, and the output of this would
typically end up in an error log.

=head3 $self->view

This returns the name of the default view for the current request.  If
it's undefined, the first view in @App::Views::V will be considered the
default.

=head3 $self->app

This returns the name of the app that this controller belongs to.

=head2 Output

=head3 $self->render($template, [ $view ])

This method will return a string generated by the specified template and view.
If a view is not specified, the first view object in @App::Views::V will be
used.

=head3 $self->redirect($path, [ $status ])

This method is a shortcut for setting $self->status to 302 and
$self->headers->{Location} to the specified URL.  You may optionally pass in a
different status code as the second parameter.
