=head1 NAME

Squatting::On::Catalyst - embed a Squatting app into a Catalyst app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Add these 4 lines to your Catalyst app's Root Controller to embed a Squatting
App.

  use App 'On::Catalyst'
  App->init;
  App->relocate('/somewhere')
  sub somewhere : Local { App->catalyze($_[1]) }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this module is to allow Squatting apps to be embedded inside
Catalyst apps.  This is done by adding a C<catalyze> method to the Squatting
app that knows how to "translate" between Catalyst and Squatting.  To use this
module, pass the string 'On::Continuity' to the use statement that loads your
Squatting app.

=head1 API

=head2 All Your Framework Are Belong To Us

=head3 App->catalyze($c)

This method takes a Catalyst object, and uses the information it contains to
let the Squatting app handle one HTTP request.  First, it translates the
Catalyst::Request object into terms Squatting can understand.  Then it lets
the Squatting app handle the request.  Finally, it takes the Squatting app's
output and populates the Catalyst::Response object.  When this method is done,
the Catalyst object should have everything it needs to send back a complete
HTTP response.

B<NOTE>:  If you want to communicate something from the Catalyst app to the
Squatting app, you can put data in $c->stash or $c->session before calling
catalyze().  From inside the Squatting app, these can be accessed via $self->v
and $self->state.
