=head1 NAME

Squatting - a Camping-inspired Web Microframework for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Running an App:

  squatting App

What a basic App looks like:

  {
    package App;
    use base 'Squatting';
    use App::Controllers;
    use App::Views;
  }

  {
    package App::Controllers;
    use Squatting ':controllers';

    # Setup a list of controller objects using the C() function.
    our @C = (
      C(
        Home => [ '/' ],
        get  => sub {
          my ($self) = @_;
          my $v = $self->v;
          $v->{title} = 'Hello, World!';
          $self->render('home');
        },
        post => sub { }
      ),
    );
  }

  {
    package App::Views;
    use Squatting ':views';

    # Setup a list of view objects using the V() function.
    our @V = (
      V(
        'html',
        layout  => sub {
          my ($self, $v, $content) = @_;
          "<html><body>$content</body></html>"
        },
        home    => sub {
          my ($self, $v) = @_;
          "<h1>$v->{title}</h1>"
        },
      ),
    );
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Squatting is a web microframework like Camping.
However, it's written in Perl, and it uses L<Continuity> as its foundation.

=head2 What does that mean?

=over 4

=item B<Concise> API

_why did a really good job in designing Camping's API, so I copied quite a bit
of the feel of Camping for Squatting.

=item B<Tiny> Codebase

Right now, it's around 7K of actual code, but it hasn't been golfed, yet,
so it can definitely get smaller.  We also made an effort to keep the number
of perl module dependencies down to a minimum.

=item B<RESTful> Controllers By Default

Controllers are objects (not classes) that are made to look like HTTP
resources.  Thus, they respond to methods like get(), post(), put(), and
delete().

=item B<RESTless> Controllers Are Possible (thanks to Continuity)

Continuation-based code can be surprisingly useful (especially for COMET), so
we try to make RESTless controllers easy to express as well.

=item B<Views> Are ...Different

The View API feels like Camping, but Squatting allows multiple views to coexist
(kinda like Catalyst (but not quite)).

=item B<Minimal> Policy

You may use any templating system you want, and you may use any ORM* you want.
We only have a few rules on how the controller code and the view code should be
organized, but beyond that, you are free.

=back

* Regarding ORMs, the nature of Continuity makes it somewhat DBI-unfriendly, so
this may be a deal-breaker for many of you.  However, I look at this as an opportunity
to try novel storage systems like CouchDB, instead.  With the high level of concurrency
that Squatting can support (thanks to Continuity) we are probably better off this way,
anyway.

=head2 Tell me more.

The next release should contain a L<Squatting::Tutorial>.  It'll provide many
examples and give you a feel for what Squatting is capable of.
Until then...

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 Bavl

We're going to throw Squatting into the metaphorical deep end by using it to
implement the towr.of.bavl.org.  If you're looking for an example of how to use
Squatting for an ambitious project, look at the Bavl codebase.

  http://github.com/beppu/bavl/tree/master

  http://towr.of.bavl.org/

=head2 Continuity and Coro

When you want to start dabbling with RESTless controllers, it would serve
you well to understand how Continuity and Coro work.  I recommend reading the
POD for the following Perl modules:

L<Continuity>,
L<Coro>,
L<Coro::Event>,
L<Event>.

=head2 Camping

Squatting is the spiritual descendant of Camping, so studying the Camping API
will indirectly teach you much of the Squatting API.

=head2 Prototype-based OO

There were a lot of obscure Ruby idioms in Camping that were damn near
impossible to directly translate into Perl.  I got around this by resorting to
techniques that are reminiscent of prototype-based OO.  (That's why controllers
and views are objects instead of classes.)

=head3 Prototypes == Grand Unified Theory of Objects

I've been coding a lot of JavaScript these days, and it has definitely
influenced my programming style.  I've come to love the simplicity of
prototype-based OO, and I think it's a damned shame that they're introducing
concepts like 'class' in the next version of JavaScript.  It's like they missed
the point of prototype-based OO.

If you're going to add anything to JavaScript, make the prototype side of it
stronger.  Look to languages like Io, and make it easier to clone objects and
manipulate an object's prototype chain.  The beauty of prototypes is that this
one concept can be used to unify objects, classes, and namespaces.  Look at Io
if you don't believe me.
