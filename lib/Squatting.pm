=head1 NAME

Squatting - A Camping-inspired Web Microframework for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Running an App:

  $ squatting App
  Please contact me at: http://localhost:4234/

Check out our ASCII art logo:

  $ squatting --logo

What a basic App looks like:

  # STEP 1 => Subclass Squatting
  {
    package App;
    use base 'Squatting';
    #use App::Controllers;
    #use App::Views;
    our %CONFIG;  # <-- standard app config goes here
  }

  # STEP 2 => Create a Controllers package
  {
    package App::Controllers;
    use Squatting ':controllers';

    # Setup a list of controller objects using the C() function.
    our @C = (
      C(
        Home => [ '/' ],
        get  => sub {
          my ($self) = @_;
          my $v = $self->v;
          $v->{title} = 'Hello, World!';
          $self->render('home');
        },
        post => sub { }
      ),
    );
  }

  # STEP 3 => Create a Views package
  {
    package App::Views;
    use Squatting ':views';

    # Setup a list of view objects using the V() function.
    our @V = (
      V(
        'html',
        layout  => sub {
          my ($self, $v, $content) = @_;
          "<html><body>$content</body></html>"
        },
        home    => sub {
          my ($self, $v) = @_;
          "<h1>$v->{title}</h1>"
        },
      ),
    );
  }

  # Models?  
  # - The whole world is your model.  ;-)
  # - I've always been ambivalent about defining policy here.
  # - Use whatever works for you.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Squatting is a web microframework based on Camping.
It originally used L<Continuity> as its foundation,
but it has since been generalized such that it can
squat on top of any Perl-based web framework (in theory).

=head2 What does this mean?

=over 4

=item B<Concise API>

_why did a really good job designing Camping's API so that you could get the
B<MOST> done with the B<LEAST> amount of code possible.  I loved Camping's API
so much that I ported it to Perl.

=item B<Tiny Codebase>

Right now, it's around 7.7K (B<*>) of actual code (after minifying), but it can
definitely get smaller.  Also, the number of Perl module dependencies has been
kept down to a minimum.

=item B<RESTful Controllers By Default>

Controllers are objects (not classes) that are made to look like HTTP
resources.  Thus, they respond to methods like get(), post(), put(), and
delete().

=item B<RESTless Controllers Are Possible>

Stateful continuation-based code can be surprisingly useful (especially for
COMET), so we try to make RESTless controllers easy to express as well. B<**>

=item B<Views Are ...Different>

The View API feels like Camping, but Squatting allows multiple views to coexist
(kinda like Catalyst (but not quite)).

=item B<Squatting Apps Are Composable>

You can take multiple Squatting apps and compose them into a single app.  For
example, suppose you built a site and decided that you'd like to add a forum.
You could take a hypothetical forum app written in Squatting and just mount
it at an arbitrary path like /forum.

=item B<Squatting Apps Are Embeddable>

Already using another framework?  No problem.  You should be able to embed
Squatting apps into apps written in anything from CGI on up to Catalyst.
(The documentation for this will be written soon.)

=item B<Minimal Policy>

You may use any templating system you want, and you may use any ORM (B<***>) you
want.  We only have a few rules on how the controller code and the view code
should be organized, but beyond that, you are free.

=back

B<*> Depending on how you measure the code size, we could be as low as 4.8K.
That's if I only count Squatting, Squatting::Controller, and Squatting::View.
When I count every perl module in this distribution, we get up to 7.7K.  I
only mention this, because Camping doesn't count everything in its 3K size.
(Sadly, I am not a master of obfuscation.  4K seemed attainable, but now that
they're down to 3K, I just don't know what to do.  ;-)

B<**> RESTless controllers only work when you're using Continuity as your
foundation.

B<***> Regarding ORMs, the nature of Continuity (B<****>) makes it somewhat
DBI-unfriendly, so this may be a deal-breaker for many of you.  However, I look
at this as an opportunity to try novel storage systems like CouchDB, instead.
With the high level of concurrency that Squatting can support (when using
Continuity) we are probably better off this way.

B<****> If you're not using Continuity, then really feel free to use any ORM.


=head1 API

=head2 Use as a Base Class for Squatting Applications

  package App;
  use base 'Squatting';
  1;

=head3 App->service($controller, @args)

Every time an HTTP request comes in, this method is called with a controller
object and a list of arguments.  The controller will then be invoked with the
HTTP method that was requested (like GET or POST), and it will return the
content of the response as a string.

B<NOTE>:  If you want to do anything before, after, or around an HTTP request,
this is the method you should override in your subclass.

=head3 App->init

This method takes no parameters and initializes some internal variables.

=head3 App->mount($AnotherApp, $prefix)

This method will mount another Squatting app at the specified prefix.

  App->mount('My::Blog',   '/my/ridiculous/rantings');
  App->mount('Forum',      '/forum');
  App->mount('ChatterBox', '/chat');

B<NOTE>:  You can only mount an app once.  Don't try to mount it again
at some other prefix, because it won't work.

=head3 App->relocate($prefix)

This method will relocate a Squatting app to the specified prefix.  It's useful
for embedding a Squatting app into apps written in other frameworks.

=head2 Use as a Helper for Controllers

  package App::Controllers;
  use Squatting ':controllers';

=head3 C($name => \@urls, %methods)

This is a shortcut for:

  Squatting::Controller->new(
    $name => \@urls, 
    app   => $App, 
    %methods
  );

=head3 R($name, @args, [ \%params ])

R() is a URL generation function that takes a controller name and a list of
arguments.  You may also pass in a hashref representing CGI variables as the
very last parameter to this function.

B<Example>:  Given the following controllers, R() would respond like this.

  # Example Controllers
  C(Home    => [ '/' ]);
  C(Profile => [ '/~(\w+)', '/~(\w+)\.(\w+)' ]);

  # Generated URLs
  R('Home')                             # "/"
  R('Home', { foo => 1, bar => 2})      # "/?foo=1&bar=2"
  R('Profile', 'larry')                 # "/~larry"
  R('Profile', 'larry', 'json')         # "/~larry.json"
                                                             
As you can see, C<@args> represents the regexp captures, and C<\%params>
represents the CGI query parameters.

=head2 Use as a Helper for Views

  package App::Controllers;
  use Squatting ':views';

=head3 V($name, %methods)

This is a shortcut for:

  Squatting::View->new($name, %methods);

=head3 R($name, @args, [ \%params ])

This is the same R() function that the controllers get access to.
Please use it to generate URLs so that your apps may be composable
and embeddable.

=head2 Squatting Source Code

The source code is short and it has some useful comments in it, so this might
be all you need to get going.  There are also some examples in the F<eg/>
directory.

L<http://github.com/beppu/squatting/tree/master>

=head2 Bavl Source Code

We're going to throw Squatting (and Continuity) into the metaphorical deep end
by using it to implement the towr.of.bavl.org.  It's a site that will help
people learn foreign languages by letting you hear the phrases you're
interested in learning as actually spoken by fluent speakers.  If you're
looking for an example of how to use Squatting for an ambitious project, look
at the Bavl code.

L<http://github.com/beppu/bavl/tree/master>

=head2 Continuity and Coro

When you want to start dabbling with RESTless controllers, it would serve you
well to understand how Continuity, Coro and Event work.  To learn more, I
recommend reading the POD for the following Perl modules:

L<Continuity>,
L<Coro>,
L<AnyEvent>.

Combining coroutines with an event loop is a surprisingly powerful technique.

=head2 Camping

Squatting is the spiritual descendant of Camping, so studying the Camping API
will indirectly teach you much of the Squatting API.

L<http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/>

=head2 Prototype-based OO

There were a lot of obscure Ruby idioms in Camping that were damn near
impossible to directly translate into Perl.  I got around this by resorting to
techniques that are reminiscent of prototype-based OO.  (That's why controllers
and views are objects instead of classes.)

=head3 Prototypes == Grand Unified Theory of Objects

I've been coding a lot of JavaScript these days, and it has definitely
influenced my programming style.  I've come to love the simplicity of
prototype-based OO, and I think it's a damned shame that they're introducing
concepts like 'class' in the next version of JavaScript.  It's like they missed
the point of prototype-based OO.

If you're going to add anything to JavaScript, make the prototype side of it
stronger.  Look to languages like Io, and make it easier to clone objects and
manipulate an object's prototype chain.  The beauty of prototypes is that you
can combine it with slot-based objects to unify the functionality of objects,
classes, and namespaces into a surprisingly simple and coherent system.  Look
at Io if you don't believe me.
