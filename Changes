Beyond (unreleased)
  * implement Squatting::With::Coro::Debug
  * give Squatting::Controller more awareness of Continuity.
    Instead of $self->cr->next, what if we could say $self->next ?
  * add proper support for file uploads wherever possible
  * SESSIONS:  Catalyst, Continuity, (and possibly Jifty)
    have nice defaults that a Squatting app can rely upon.
    However, the rest of the backends are lower level, and
    session storage is an open question there.  I'd like to
    create a standard way for the Squatting::On::* family to
    setup session storage.
  * do a better job of simulating requests in squatting -C
  * BUG: POST -> perlbal -> thttpd -> Squatting::On::CGI == FAIL
    Strangely enough, GET is fine.
    Take perlbal out of the setup and everything is fine.
  * implement Squatting::On::HTTP::Engine
  * implement Squatting::On::MP19
  * implement Squatting::On::Jifty
  * resurrect Squatting::H ?

0.60 (unreleased)
  - More documentation updates and corrections.
  - Fixed URL for Tenjin in Squatting::Cookbook.
  - Implemented Squatting::With::Log
  - added --module parameter to bin/squatting
  - added default in-memory session to Squatting::On::Continuity
    (I discovered that session setup can't happen via the plugin system.
    If I want sessions, they have to be setup before service is called.)
  - removed bin/vw from distribution, because it will be
    distributed with App::VW from now on.
  * implement Squatting::On::MP13
  * implement Squatting::On::MP20
  * implement Squatting::On::FastCGI

  - Removed $Squatting::app and became both mod_perl compatible and embeddable.
  - Added unit tests for Squatting::Controller and Squatting::View
  - Allow views to have access to outgoing HTTP headers.
  - Fixed yet another obscure cookie bug.
  - Learned that the attribute handler in Squatting::Q must be invoked
    during the INIT phase rather than the earlier CHECK phase, because
    the coderef's address during the CHECK phase may not be final.
    (Trivia:  coderef's that close over variables outside their own
    lexical scope get changed sometime after the CHECK phase.)
  - Unfortunately, even that's not good enough.
    Squatting::Q has been removed, because Attribute::Handlers
    can't be made to work for this purpose.  (RIP Squatting::Q July 4, 2008)
