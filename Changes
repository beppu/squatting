Beyond (unreleased)
  * give Squatting::Controller more awareness of Continuity.
    Instead of $self->cr->next, what if we could say $self->next ?
  * add proper support for file uploads wherever possible.
    # I think adding an upload method to the controllers would work.
  * do a better job of simulating requests in squatting -C
  * BUG: POST -> perlbal -> thttpd -> Squatting::On::CGI == FAIL
    Strangely enough, GET is fine.
    Take perlbal out of the setup and everything is fine.
  * implement Squatting::On::MP19
  * implement Squatting::On::Jifty
  * in Squatting::Controller's POD, teach people how to document controllers.
  * in Squatting::View's POD, teach people how to document views.
  * consider writing a module-starter plugin

  - Allow views to have access to outgoing HTTP headers.
  - Fixed yet another obscure cookie bug.
  - Learned that the attribute handler in Squatting::Q must be invoked
    during the INIT phase rather than the earlier CHECK phase, because
    the coderef's address during the CHECK phase may not be final.
    (Trivia:  coderef's that close over variables outside their own
    lexical scope get changed sometime after the CHECK phase.)
  - Unfortunately, even that's not good enough.
    Squatting::Q has been removed, because Attribute::Handlers
    can't be made to work for this purpose.  (RIP Squatting::Q July 4, 2008)
