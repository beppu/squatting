Beyond (unreleased)
  * add proper support for file uploads wherever possible.  #lack-of-maturity
    # I think adding an upload method to the controllers would work.
  * do a better job of simulating requests in squatting -C
  * BUG: POST -> perlbal -> thttpd -> Squatting::On::CGI == FAIL
    Strangely enough, GET is fine.
    Take perlbal out of the setup and everything is fine.
  * implement Squatting::On::Jifty
  * implement Squatting::On::Squatting
    * move mount method out of the core and into Squatting::With::Mount
  * use Rhetoric and Pod::Server as examples of how to document a Squatting app.
    * OLD: in Squatting::Controller's POD, teach people how to document controllers.
    * OLD: in Squatting::View's POD, teach people how to document views.
  * Make bin/squatting use Plack::Runner
  * Things that would make Squatting easier to get started with:
    - an app generator (using Module::Setup?)
      - PSGI support by default
  * Replace Shell::Perl with something based on Eval::WithLexicals.

0.80 unreleased
  - [ MAJOR API CHANGE! ]
    - You don't say:  use base 'Squatting' anymore.
    - When creating a Squatting app,
      you just say:   use Squatting;
    - You don't say:  use Squatting ':controllers' or
                      use Squatting ':views' anymore
    - use Squatting takes care of what those statements used to do.
  - Squatting::H->merge renamed to Squatting::H->extend to
    be consistent w/ the way these words are used in contemporary
    Javascript libraries.
  - Added Squatting::With::PerHostConfig
  - hacked bin/squatting so that the console experience is a bit nicer.
    App->get and App->post will work a tiny bit more reliably.

0.70 2009-08-27
  - reimplemented Squatting::With::Log using Squatting::H
  - added Squatting::H->bless (breaking all the rules ;)
  - changed Squatting::Mapper semantics
    - $controller->{queue} has been deprecated in favor of
      $controller->{continuity}
    - Squatting::Mapper now dispatches on
      $sid + $controller + $path
      (in that order)
      - It used to just be $sid + $controller,
        but when people start opening multiple tabs,
        that wasn't enough.  It was necessary to be
        able to distinguish between the different tabs,
        and putting something random at the end of a path
        was one way to do that, so it's now the default.
  - updated L<Squatting::Cookbook/The Anatomy of a Squatting Application>

0.60 2009-04-21
  - More documentation updates and corrections.
  - Fixed URL for Tenjin in Squatting::Cookbook.
  - Implemented Squatting::With::Log
  - added --module parameter to bin/squatting
  - added default in-memory session to Squatting::On::Continuity
  - removed bin/vw from distribution, because it will be
    distributed with App::VW from now on.
  - worked around a weird bug where
    Squatting::On::Catalyst + FastCGI
    was using the wrong path.
  - added support for nested %CONFIG vars in bin/squatting
  - resurrected Squatting::H
  - implemented Squatting::With::Coro::Debug
  - implemented Squatting::On::MP13
  - implemented Squatting::On::MP20

0.50
  - More documentation updates and corrections.
  - Moved last if-block in service to Squatting::On::Continuity
  - Moved controller log into Squatting::With::AccessTrace
  - Allow more HTTP methods when using Squatting::On::Continuity
  - Started documenting Continuity's special powers.

0.42
  - Revised the documentation a bit.
  - Made squatting --help have a higher precedence.

0.41
  - Fixed a few documentation errors.
  - Minimized namespace pollution from Squatting::On::* plugins.
  - Fixed Squatting <=> Catalyst cookie mapping.

0.40
  - Removed $Squatting::app and became both mod_perl compatible and embeddable.
  - Added unit tests for Squatting::Controller and Squatting::View
  - Allow views to have access to outgoing HTTP headers.
  - Fixed yet another obscure cookie bug.
  - Learned that the attribute handler in Squatting::Q must be invoked
    during the INIT phase rather than the earlier CHECK phase, because
    the coderef's address during the CHECK phase may not be final.
    (Trivia:  coderef's that close over variables outside their own
    lexical scope get changed sometime after the CHECK phase.)
  - Unfortunately, even that's not good enough.
    Squatting::Q has been removed, because Attribute::Handlers
    can't be made to work for this purpose.  (RIP Squatting::Q July 4, 2008)
  - Implemented Squatting::On::Catalyst.
  - Implemented Squatting::On::Continuity.
  - We're using Class::C3::Componentised to load extensions like
    those found in Squatting::On::*.
