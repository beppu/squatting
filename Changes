0.40
  - Removed $Squatting::app and became both mod_perl compatible and embeddable.
  - Added unit tests for Squatting::Controller and Squatting::View
  - Allow views to have access to outgoing HTTP headers.
  - Fixed yet another obscure cookie bug.
  - Learned that the attribute handler in Squatting::Q must be invoked
    during the INIT phase rather than the earlier CHECK phase, because
    the coderef's address during the CHECK phase may not be final.
    (Trivia:  coderef's that close over variables outside their own
    lexical scope get changed sometime after the CHECK phase.)
