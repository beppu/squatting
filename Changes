0.42

0.41
  - Fixed a few documentation errors.
  - Minimized namespace pollution from Squatting::On::* plugins.
  - Fixed Squatting <=> Catalyst cookie mapping.

0.40
  - Removed $Squatting::app and became both mod_perl compatible and embeddable.
  - Added unit tests for Squatting::Controller and Squatting::View
  - Allow views to have access to outgoing HTTP headers.
  - Fixed yet another obscure cookie bug.
  - Learned that the attribute handler in Squatting::Q must be invoked
    during the INIT phase rather than the earlier CHECK phase, because
    the coderef's address during the CHECK phase may not be final.
    (Trivia:  coderef's that close over variables outside their own
    lexical scope get changed sometime after the CHECK phase.)
  - Unfortunately, even that's not good enough.
    Squatting::Q has been removed, because Attribute::Handlers
    can't be made to work for this purpose.  (RIP Squatting::Q July 4, 2008)
  - Implemented Squatting::On::Catalyst.
  - Implemented Squatting::On::Continuity.
  - We're using Class::C3::Componentised to load extensions like
    those found in Squatting::On::*.

  - Added sample application, UniCodePoints.
